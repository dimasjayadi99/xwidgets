/// A horizontal single dashed line divider drawn using a custom painter.

/// Features:
/// - Custom dash width
/// - Custom dash gap
/// - Adjustable stroke thickness
/// - Custom color
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// XSingleDashedLine(
///   dashWidth: 6,
///   dashGap: 3,
///   strokeWidth: 1,
///   color: Colors.grey,
/// );
/// ```

/// - Receipt-style layouts
/// - Informational sections
/// - Decorative separators
